        A couple friendly reminders:
          1. Remove the `user docs` label if the scope of this work does not require changes to https://docs.getdbt.com/docs: no end-user interface (e.g. yml spec, CLI, error messages, etc) or functional changes
          2. Link any blocking issues in the "Blocked on" field under the "Core devs & maintainers" project.

        Will this change impact other teams?  Include details of the kinds of changes required (new tests, code changes, related tickets) and _add the relevant `Impact:[team]` label_.

      description: |
        Will this change need to be backported to previous versions?  Add details, possible blockers to backporting and _add the relevant backport labels `backport 1.x.latest`_
      placeholder: |
        Example: Backport to 1.6.latest, 1.5.latest and 1.4.latest.  Since 1.4 isn't using click, the backport may be complicated. The `backport 1.6.latest`, `backport 1.5.latest` and `backport 1.4.latest` labels have been added.
